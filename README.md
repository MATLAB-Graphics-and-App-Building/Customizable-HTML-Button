This custom UI component creates a button that is customizable in several additional ways with respect to the built-in ``uibutton`` component in MATLAB&reg;. Additional customizations can be added with JavaScript&reg; and CSS. This custom component can be included inside graphical user interfaces and be made available inside App Designer.
